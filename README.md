## Running the Site Locally

If you don't want to mess with Git and just want to see the website, you should
be able to download the website from GitHub. Otherwise,
[install Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) and clone this
repository.

Once you've got the website, open a command prompt or Powershell window
(Windows) or a Terminal window (Mac) and change into the website directory.

* For Windows users, if you've place the website in
  C:\Hugo\Sites\playing_rough_blog, the command is
  `cd C:\Hugo\Sites\playing_rough_blog`
* For Mac, if you've placed the website in ~/Hugo/Sites/playing_rough_blog, the
  command is `cd ~/Hugo/Sites/playing_rough_blog`

Once in the directory, run `hugo server` and then open a web browser to
[http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/) to see the blog.
